# Scripts

## nmap script

`nerd.nse` script in LUA for nmap (www.nmap.org), which
allows users to look up a scanned target in NERD.
The script requires API token stored in a file called `nerdapifile`
in the current working directory or it is possible to specify path
to the file using `--script-args` (`nerd.apifile=`).
