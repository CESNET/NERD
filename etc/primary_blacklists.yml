# NERD config - primary blacklists
# used by blacklists.py script
---

# List specification:
#   id (used as key in records),
#   name (for humans),
#   url (http(s):// or file://, if local file is used, it should be updated by external cron script)
#   regex to parse the file (should match on IP address) or empty if there are only IP addresses, one per line (lines beginning with '#' are ignored),
#       or just fill regex with searching for IP, IP prefix or domain without group, if the whole blacklist is on one line or has multiple records on on line
#       - you can use special substitutions for IP address or CIDR IP address
#         - "\\A" can be used for IP address, in internal part it will be substituted for IP regex
#         - "\\CA" can be used for CIDR prefix (192.168.0.0/16)
#       IP address regex example, where IP address starts on every line:
#         "^(\\A)"
#   refresh time (cron-like specification of when the list should be updated (in UTC), see https://apscheduler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/triggers/cron.html for details)
#   other params (optional)
#
#   The last parameter is a dictionary of other parameters. The following keys are recognized:
#     url_params - dict of key-value pairs to pass as GET parameters in URL
#     headers - dict of key-value pairs specyfing additional HTTP headers
#   Example of url_params and headers usage can be viewed below in Abuse IP DB blacklist specification.
